VisualDSA – Bringing Data Structures to Life 🚀

Step into the world where logic dances with visuals—where abstract algorithms transform into interactive experiences. VisualDSA is not just a project; it’s a living, breathing guide through the fascinating realm of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).

🌟 What It Is

VisualDSA is a web-based application built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python (Flask). It turns the often-intimidating concepts of DSA into playful, interactive visualizations. Watch as stacks rise and fall, queues flow, and linked lists weave their way through your screen—all with a few clicks.

🎯 Features

Stacks & Queues – See push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue come alive.

Linked Lists – Traverse and manipulate nodes in real-time.

Trees & Graphs – Explore hierarchies and connections visually.

Algorithms – Sorting and searching, step by step, illustrated dynamically.

Every operation is visual, interactive, and intuitive—designed to make learning fun, fast, and unforgettable.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript – sleek and responsive.

Backend: Python (Flask) – powering the logic seamlessly.

Deployment: Vercel – instant access anywhere, anytime.

🚀 Why It Matters

VisualDSA is a bridge between theory and practice. It lets you:

Visualize complex structures in motion.

Experiment safely and learn by doing.
